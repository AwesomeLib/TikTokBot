# TikTok Video Bot

This project downloads the trending tiktok videos and compiles them into a video.

**NOTE** This project will most likely be behind my TikTok-API. Adapt that to use FFMpeg if you want a better experience (TikTok-API)[https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api]. I will still update this just it will most likely be a few updates behind that other repo.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installing and Prerequisites

You need to have ffmpeg installed and in your path variable, tutorial (here)[https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10].
Also, make sure you have in the directory of tiktokbot.py folders called output and downloaded.

Python Requirements
